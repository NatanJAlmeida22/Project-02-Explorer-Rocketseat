## ðŸš€ Technologies

This project was developed with the following technologies

- HTML and CSS
- Git and GitHub
- Figma

## Project

Project-01 was meant to introduce basic HTML and CSS concepts. In this project I had the opportunity to improve my knowledge about:

- texts, placements, spacing and introduction to new properties;
- HTML semantic tags like 'header', 'nav', 'ul', 'li', 'main', 'section' and 'footer';
- CSS Box Model concepts;
- difference between "margin" and "padding" and design styling;
- use of the "DevTools", which comes by default in our browser, to see, in practice, the Box Model concept and its functionalities;
- use of the "DevTools" to help with the creation of the project's menu (with it it was possible to see the changes in real time and then pass everything to the code);
- concepts of "accessibility" and "refactoring" to improve the code and enable better understanding;
- specificity of CSS elements;
- new CSS properties like: background, cursor and border-radius;
- utilizar a 'funÃ§Ã£o linear-gradient()', entendendo suas propriedades e visualizando o resultado do gradiente no pelo navegador.
